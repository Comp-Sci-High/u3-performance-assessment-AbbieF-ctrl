1. Why did you pick this API topic?
 Answer: I chose this API topic because it was simple. I don't really know how to do the more complex stuff with App.get and app.use, so I chose the simple topics.

 2. Describe your API and the available data endpoints
It's a simple API. It only has a few endpoints, /facts/dogs, /facts/cats, /facts/birds, /facts/bunnies, and /facts/snakes. All have at least 5 facts about the animal.

3. How was your experience building your own API server after using other APIs as a client in Unit 2?
It was much more easier to use. It also was quicker to actually finish compared to the client in Unit 2.
